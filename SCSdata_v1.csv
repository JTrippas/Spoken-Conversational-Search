Here are five jobs that are experiencing this phenomenon, which is you know jobs moving to overseas so one is nursing and then the next one is call centres uhm... yes so and under nursing they're saying uhm... they are noting that it's it's it's difficult to outsource medical functions such as surgeries and rehabilitation. However there's plenty of paperwork so the paperwork aspect for nursing for instance is going overseas, so let's quickly look at the next one. The next is call centres so with call centre customer care call centre kind of work, they say the Philippines has become a popular location for it call centres uhm... links [inaudible segment]. Philippines has links to the US and because they're English they have a large English speaking population so major computer makers, hotels and banks are examples of industries that have make call centres work. The third one is research and development uhm so examples that are given are technology giant like Microsoft which has recently opened a hundred million research centre in Shanghai so an example of it is research and development job is Shanghai uhm, I can see the next one which will be the fourth one is manufacturing, so let's have a look at manufacturing uhm large manufacturing firms, example General Electric and Boeing Boeing, have outsourced key manufacturing capabilities overseas. Uhm until recently, China and other countries such as Vietnam offered huge differences OK in hourly wages so I think one incentive has been the hourly wage wage China Vietnam, it is taking advantage of so, the last on is business","10"
